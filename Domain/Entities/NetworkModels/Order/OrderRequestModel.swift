Use the leavesQty field to specify how much of the order you wish to remain open. This can be useful if you want to adjust your position's delta by a certain amount, regardless of how much of the order has already filled. > A leavesQty can be used to make a "Filled" order live again, if it is received within 60 seconds of the fill. Like order placement, amending can be done in bulk. Simply send a request to PUT /api/v1/order/bulk with a JSON body of the shape: {"orders": [{...}, {...}]}, each object containing the fields used in this endpoint.

  /// Implementation Notes: This endpoint is used for placing bulk orders. Valid order types are Market, Limit, Stop, StopLimit, MarketIfTouched, LimitIfTouched, and Pegged. Each individual order object in the array should have the same properties as an individual POST /order call. This endpoint is much faster for getting many orders into the book at once. Because it reduces load on BitMEX systems, this endpoint is ratelimited at ceil(0.1 * orders). Submitting 10 orders via a bulk order call will only count as 1 request, 15 as 2, 32 as 4, and so on. For now, only application/json is supported on this endpoint.
